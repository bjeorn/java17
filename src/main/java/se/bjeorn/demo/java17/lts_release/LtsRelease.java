    // Since the introduction of the changes in the release model, the LTS versions were
    // Java SE 11 (released in September 2018) and Java SE 17 (released in September 2021).
    // Nonetheless, version 17 brought something new to the model.
    // In short, the interval between LTS versions is now two years instead of three,
    // making Java 21 (planned for September 2023) probably the next LTS.
